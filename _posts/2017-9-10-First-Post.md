Hello, my name is Jacob Edie. I created this blog as a way to promote and host my "One code project per week challenge!" The main reason for making this challenge for myself was to help further develop my skills as a programmer and to work on my "completing" skills. I was partly inspired by lessmilk's "One game per week challenge."

## A little about me:
-I am a freshman majoring in computer science at the University of Kentucky.

-I am in the Wildcat Marching Band and play the alto saxophone.

-I am on the Solar car team for UKy and more specifically working on the GPS system for the car along with other teammates.

-I am also a part of IEEE or Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

## About the challenge
The rules for this challenge are fairly simple. Create a small code project by Sunday at midnight and also create a blog post detailing the proccess of creating said project. The biggest challenge in this challenge will definitely be sticking to it.
